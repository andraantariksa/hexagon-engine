# Hexagon Engine coding style

## Rules
- Allman braces style are must!
- Classes and Variables must use CamelCasing (ex: `MyClass` / `MyVariable`)
- Structs must begin with 'S' prefix and followed by a name with CamelCasing (ex: `SMyStruct`)
- Enums must begin with 'E' prefix and followed by a name with CamelCasing (ex: `EMyEnum`)
- Interfaces/Abstract classes must begin with 'I' prefix and followed by a name with CamelCasing (ex: `IMyInterface`)
- Use `this->` when using a member function/variable (ex: `this->MyVariable`, `this->MyFunction()`)
- Use `struct` for declaring an Interface/Abstract class

## Basic type aliases for C++ type
| Type alias | original           |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| int8       | char               |
| int16      | short              |
| int32      | int                |
| int64      | long long          |
| uint8      | unsigned char      |
| uint16     | unsigned short     |
| uint32     | unsigned int       |
| uint64     | unsigned long long |
